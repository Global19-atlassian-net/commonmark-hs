## Pipe Tables

Our pipe tables are like GFM pipe tables, and this spec is
based on the GFM spec, but with a few differences:

- Every row of a table needs to start with `|` and end with
  (unescaped) `|`; so tables like
  ```
  a|b
  -|-
  1|2
  ```
  are not supported. this is to increase parsing efficiency.

- Tables end when a line that does not start with `|` and end with
  `|` is encountered.

A [table](@) is an arrangement of data with rows and columns, consisting of a
single header row, a [delimiter row] separating the header from the data, and
zero or more data rows.

Each row consists of cells containing arbitrary text, in which [inlines] are
parsed, separated by pipes (`|`).  A leading and trailing pipe is also
required.  Spaces between pipes and cell content are trimmed.
Block-level elements cannot be inserted in a table.

The [delimiter row](@) consists of cells whose only content are hyphens (`-`),
and optionally, a leading or trailing colon (`:`), or both, to indicate left,
right, or center alignment respectively.

```````````````````````````````` example
| foo | bar |
| --- | --- |
| baz | bim |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>foo</th>
<th>bar</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>baz</td>
<td>bim</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

Cells in one column don't need to match length, though it's easier to read if
they are.

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | defghi |
|:-: | -----------:|
|bar | baz  |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">abc</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">defghi</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">bar</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">baz</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

Include a pipe in a cell's content by escaping it. Note that
`\|` inside inline code backticks is treated as a literal `|`,
and thus differently than in code backticks outside of table cells.

```````````````````````````````` example
| f\|oo  |
| ------ |
| b `\|` az |
| b **\|** im |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>f|oo</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>b <code>|</code> az</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b <strong>|</strong> im</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

The table is broken at the line that does not begin and end with a `|`
character.

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| bar | baz |
> bar
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td>baz</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>bar</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| bar | baz |
bar

bar
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td>baz</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>bar</p>
<p>bar</p>
````````````````````````````````

The header row must match the [delimiter row] in the number of cells.  If not,
a table will not be recognized:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- |
| bar |
.
<p>| abc | def |
| --- |
| bar |</p>
````````````````````````````````

The remainder of the table's rows may vary in the number of cells.  If there
are a number of cells fewer than the number of cells in the header row, empty
cells are inserted.  If there are greater, the excess is ignored:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| bar |
| bar | baz | boo |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bar</td>
<td>baz</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
````````````````````````````````

If there are no rows in the body, no `<tbody>` is generated in HTML output:

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc</th>
<th>def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
````````````````````````````````
