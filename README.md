This repository contains three packages:

- [`commonmark`](commonmark/):
  a pure Haskell library for parsing commonmark,
  designed for flexibility and extensibility.

- [`commonmark-pandoc`](commonmark-pandoc/):
  type instances for parsing commonmark as a Pandoc AST.

- [`commonmark-extensions`](commonmark-extensions/):
  a set of useful extensions to core commonmark syntax.

- [`commonmark-cli`](commonmark-cli/): a
  command-line program that uses this library to convert
  and syntax-highlight commonmark documents.

See the [`commonmark` README](commonmark/) for a
more detailed description of the project's goals.
