## Strikethrough

Basic strikethrough is between two tildes:

```````````````````````````````` example
~~This is *stricken out*~~
.
<p><del>This is <em>stricken out</em></del></p>
````````````````````````````````

One tilde does nothing:

```````````````````````````````` example
~This is nothing~
.
<p>~This is nothing~</p>
````````````````````````````````

Backslash escapes:

```````````````````````````````` example
~~This is \~\~stricken~~
.
<p><del>This is ~~stricken</del></p>
````````````````````````````````
