* TODO free monad?
this would give more flexibility e.g. to combine words in inline
parsing.  maybe also simplify.
* TODO cli - add syntax highlighting with Skylighting (makes it GPL)
* TODO Inlines - try to add back some efficiency lost with getWords?
* TODO code block includes
example of modifying an existing one...
``` haskell source="myfile.hs" lines=3-6
```
Modify the blockConstructor in the fencedCodeSpec.
Runs in IO.
* TODO fenced divs
* TODO fix two cases in CommonMark spec marked IGNORE
these are spec bugs.  Also fix reference implementation.
* TODO add this to CommonMark test suite:
hi
    there
* NOTES on performance:
_ changing Token to (Int, Int) didn't help
_ remove processBrackets and processEmphasis entirely didn't affect timing or memory
