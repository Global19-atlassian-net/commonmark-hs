This seems to require a different API
Somehow we have to pass the footnote map to the inline
parser...
The extension mechanism should be flexible enough for this,
but it's hard to see how to do it.
Instead of referenceMap in BPState and IPState, we could
have something which can be parameterized with a typeclass
like HasReferenceMap.
Make sure it is a monoid (or maybe has a default instance),
so we can initialize it.
class HasReferenceMap a where
  getReferenceMap :: a -> ReferenceMap
  setReferenceMap :: a -> ReferenceMap -> a
