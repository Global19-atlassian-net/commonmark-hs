Attributes have the syntax described in heading_attributes.txt.
They must immediately follow a code span (with no space).

```````````````````````````````` example
`hi`{#ident .class key=value}
.
<p><code id="ident" class="class" key="value">hi</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
`hi` {#ident .class key=value}
.
<p><code>hi</code> </p>
````````````````````````````````

The attributes can wrap:

```````````````````````````````` example
`hi`{#ident .class
key=value}
.
<p><code id="ident" class="class" key="value">hi</code></p>
````````````````````````````````
