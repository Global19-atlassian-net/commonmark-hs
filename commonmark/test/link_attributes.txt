Attributes come after the link or image.
Attributes have the syntax described in
`heading_attributes.txt`.

```````````````````````````````` example
[foo](bar){#ident .class key="value value" key2=value2}
.
<p><a id="ident" class="class" key="value value" key2="value2" href="bar">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
![foo](bar){#ident .centered .big}
.
<p><img id="ident" class="centered big" src="bar" alt="foo" /></p>
````````````````````````````````

Reference links work too:

```````````````````````````````` example
[foo]{#ident .centered .big}

[foo]: bar
.
<p><a id="ident" class="centered big" href="bar">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

Attributes can also be defined in link reference definitions:

```````````````````````````````` example
[foo]

[foo]: bar "title" {#ident .centered .big}
.
<p><a id="ident" class="centered big" href="bar" title="title">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````
