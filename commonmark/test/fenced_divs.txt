Fenced divs are containers for sequences of blocks, to
which an attribute can be attached.

A fenced div begins with an opening fence: a line with three or
more consecutive `:` characters, followed by an attribute
specifier, followed by optional whitespace and the end of the
line.

It ends with a closing fence: a line beginning with at
least as many consecutive `:` characters as in the opening
fence, followed by optional whitespace and the end of the line.

```````````````````````````````` example
::: {#bar .foo}
Hi

> A block quote.
:::
.
<div id="bar" class="foo">
<p>Hi</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
:::: {#bar .foo} 
Hi

> A block quote.
::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
.
<div id="bar" class="foo">
<p>Hi</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

Fenced divs may be nested.

```````````````````````````````` example
::: {#bar .foo}
Hi
::: {.baz}
> A block quote.
:::
:::
.
<div id="bar" class="foo">
<p>Hi</p>
<div class="baz"
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

A fenced div cannot interrupt a paragraph. A blank line
must separate the end of paragraph content from a subsequent
fenced div.

```````````````````````````````` example
Paragraph text
::: {#bar .foo}
Hi
:::
.
<p>Paragraph text
::: {#bar .foo}
Hi
:::</p>
````````````````````````````````

A fenced div *must* have attributes.

```````````````````````````````` example
:::
Hi
:::
.
<p>:::
Hi
:::</p>
````````````````````````````````
