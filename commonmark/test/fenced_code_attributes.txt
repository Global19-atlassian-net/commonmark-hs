Attributes have the syntax described in heading_attributes.txt,
with one addition.  A "raw attribute" is an `=` plus an
alphanumeric string, like

    {=html5}

A raw attribute may not occur together with other attributes.
It causes the code block to be interpreted as raw content in
the selected output format.

They can occur after either backtick or tilde style code fences.

```````````````````````````````` example
``` {#ident .class key="value value" key2=value2} 
xyz
```
.
<pre id="ident" class="class" key="value value" key2="value2"><code>xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
~~~~{#mycode .ruby .number-lines}
xyz
~~~~
.
<pre id="mycode" class="ruby number-lines"><code>xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

If anything but the attribute spec is present, the
whole thing is treated as a raw info string.

```````````````````````````````` example
``` {#foo} bar
xyz
```
.
<pre><code class="language-{#foo}">xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
``` bar {#foo}
xyz
```
.
<pre><code class="language-bar">xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
``` {=html}
<b>foo</b>
```
.
<b>foo</b>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
``` {=html #id}
<b>foo</b>
```
.
<pre><code class="language-{=html">&lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````
