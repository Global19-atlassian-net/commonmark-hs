Attributes have the synatx described in heading_attributes.txt.
They can occur after either backtick or tilde style code fences.

```````````````````````````````` example
``` {#ident .class key="value value" key2=value2} 
xyz
```
.
<pre id="ident" class="class" key="value value" key2="value2"><code>xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
~~~~{#mycode .ruby .number-lines}
xyz
~~~~
.
<pre id="mycode" class="ruby number-lines"><code>xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

If anything but the attribute spec is present, the
whole thing is treated as a raw info string.

```````````````````````````````` example
``` {#foo} bar
xyz
```
.
<pre><code class="language-{#foo}">xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
``` bar {#foo}
xyz
```
.
<pre><code class="language-bar">xyz
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````
